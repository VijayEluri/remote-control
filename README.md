This is the beginning of separating the core functionality of the [grails-remote-control](http://github.com/alkemist/grails-remote-control) plugin out of Grails to make it available to all Groovy users.

In a nutshell, this library allows you to transmit closures to remote JVMs and execute them inside that JVM. There is a pluggable transport mechanism, with currently an implementation for http.

More information will be forthcoming.
